Hi, I'm Harry Bovik. For over a decade now people have been sending me opinions on all sorts of local topics. I have stored these messages in such a way that a user of any of the local computers can read them. If you are inside CMU campus, click here for my maiI. I'm grateful for any information you might have too, so please pass it on!
