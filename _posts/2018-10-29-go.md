title: Go over Nabla- App Safety meets Host Isolation
---

This blog presents how a Go application can be built and run as a Nabla container.
We take an example of a web server application, part of the [nabla-demo-apps](https://github.com/Nabla-containers/nabla-demo-apps) repository.
To enable/port Go over Nabla, we also briefly present certain key modifications made to the Go runtime.



### Application build
The httpd example highlights Nabla's support for Go applications organized across multiple .go files, multiple packages, as well as third-party package imports from github.

In the [sample code](https://github.com/nabla-containers/nabla-demo-apps/tree/master/go-httpd/src), the `main()` function in httpd.go uses a utility function from the helper package (helper/process_args.go) to parse the commandline arguments. 
After some trivial commandline parsing, the webserver awaits HTTP GETs at port 3000 from the outside world.

Building this Go webserver as a Nabla container is pretty straightforward. 
[Dockerfile.Nabla](https://github.com/nabla-containers/nabla-demo-apps/blob/master/go-httpd/Dockerfile.nabla) lists the steps required for a multi-stage build of the Go app.
First, the app's source directory is added to the [`nabla-go-base`](https://github.com/nabla-containers/nabla-base-build/tree/master/go-base) image, which contains the Go runtime ported over Nabla (see Section 'Under the Covers'). 
This is followed by the usual `go get` of the dependencies.
After this, a generic [Makefile.Goapp](https://github.com/nabla-containers/nabla-base-build/blob/master/go-base/Makefile.goapp) (part of the base image itself) is triggered, which builds the Go app as a static Nabla binary.
The resulting binary then becomes the entrypoint of the Go app Nabla container, which can be run using the [`runnc`](https://github.com/nabla-containers/runnc) Nabla-container runtime as `docker run -it --rm --runtime=runnc go-httpd-Nabla`.


### Under the covers
The Nabla Go base is built on top of [Gorump](https://github.com/deferpanic/gorump), a port of Go for the Rumprun unikernel (one of the Library OSes Nabla supports).
Nabla currently supports Go-1.5.1 (one of the two versions ported by Gorump).
Gorump modifies Go to add a new supported 'GOOS'- rumprun.
Although this enables running Go applications as unikernel VMs, they can't be run as-is as a Nabla container, unlike [python](https://github.com/nabla-containers/nabla-base-build/tree/master/python3-base) or [node](https://github.com/nabla-containers/nabla-base-build/tree/master/node-base) applications.

This happens because Go runtime's requirement on platform-specific Thread Local Storage (TLS), is at odds with the host system interface Nabla permits to offer increased container isolation.
Specifically, the Go runtime uses TLS to store a pointer to a 'G' structure containing internal details specific to each individual Go routine (a nice description can be found [here](https://blog.altoros.com/Golang-internals-part-3-the-linker-and-object-files.html)).
In AMD64, the TLS implementation translates to setting segment registers (FS/GS). The corresponding syscall to access these registers (`arch_prctl(ARCH_SET_FS,..)` in Linux, `_lwp_setprivate()` in BSD) is not part of the default Nabla seccomp policy<sup>1</sup>.
While it could be added, the resulting impact on system isolation would need to be explored, which is a non-trivial task.

Another alternative is to handle TLS in software (potentially at a performance cost).
Our port of Go on Nabla uses this approach, by using the POSIX `pthread_setspecific()` interface (managed inside rumprun) to provide TLS to the Go runtime.


<sup>1 Other TLS implementations, such as modify_ldt() for i386 architectures, and set_thread_area(), would also require expanding Nabla's seccomp policy to allow the respective syscalls.
